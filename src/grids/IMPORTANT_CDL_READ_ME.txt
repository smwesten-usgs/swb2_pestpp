** VERY IMPORTANT **

The CDL grid files @1000m for 2000 to 2007 are **FAKE**.  They are named as such so that 
swb2 can read some input for runs prior to 2008, when CDL data were not available. 

The files were copied from later years as follows:

2000 = 2010
2001 = 2011
2002 = 2012
2003 = 2013
2004 = 2014
2005 = 2015
2006 = 2016
2007 = 2017

This was done so that the years previous to 2008 were not static.
